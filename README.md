This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## The plan

- To build a simple quiz app that offers MCQ-style tests of general or specialised trivia.
- To consume third-party APIs for questions and answers.
- To shuffle the anwser options once the questions are fetched.
- To tally scores.

## So far

- Basic application logic in place
- Score-tallying and game reset
- Questions are still hardcoded

## Still to be done

- API consumption
- Shuffling
- Design
